How to run the stuff:
First run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt". This will install all of the required libraries needed for the program to run.
In order for the program in the perception_pkg to run properly, it requires aerial imagery (that has been run through a semantic segmentation algorithm) of the region of interest + the corresponding LiDAR data. In the perception_pkg, aerial imagery (.tif) + LiDAR data
for a region in Cedar Park, Texas has been provided. The program is currently set up to run on that region.
