# NSSSIP2023 - Perception Package

This package (perception_pkg) contains the best-location-for-sensor-placement algorithm. This algorithm reads and analyzes a semantic segmented aerial imagery of some region, as well as the corresponding LiDAR data. 

## Program Requirements:
- This program requires a variety of libraries, which are located in the requirements.txt file. You can install all of the libraries at by running the terminal-command **pip install -r requirements.txt**. 
- In order for the algorithm to analyze a region of interest, it requires the aerial imagery (that has been run through a semantic segmented algorithm) and the corresponding LiDAR data. It is advised to also have the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) image. All images must be in a .tif format.
